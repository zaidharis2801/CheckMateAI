# CheckMateAI

## Description

CheckMateAI is a powerful, artificially intelligent checkers player designed using the Minimax algorithm with depth-limiting and Alpha-Beta pruning for improved efficiency and performance. This game AI can analyze multiple game states and make decisions strategically, creating a challenging gaming experience for checkers enthusiasts.

## Features

- Utilizes Minimax algorithm with a depth-limited approach and Alpha-Beta pruning for decision making.
- Built to provide a challenging AI opponent for a game of checkers.
- Interactive game interface.
- Suitable for both beginners and advanced checkers players looking to up their game.
- Enhanced performance through depth-based approach and Alpha-Beta pruning, ensuring efficient and strategic gameplay.

## Installation

To get started with CheckMateAI, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `https://github.com/zaidharis2801/CheckMateAI.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory. For example, `cd CheckMateAI`.
3. Run the AI player by executing the main file. 

## How It Works

CheckMateAI uses the Minimax algorithm, a recursive algorithm for decision making. In the context of this game, it's used for choosing the optimal move for the AI player at any given state of the game. 

The Minimax algorithm works by projecting the possible future states of the game (in this case, potential checkers board configurations), and then making a decision based on minimizing the worst-case scenario (i.e., a loss). 

CheckMateAI implements a depth-based approach, limiting the depth of the game tree explored by the Minimax algorithm. This optimization improves the efficiency of the AI, reducing the computational load while still allowing the AI to make competitive moves.

Furthermore, CheckMateAI uses Alpha-Beta pruning, an optimization technique that significantly reduces the number of nodes evaluated by the Minimax algorithm. This pruning allows the AI to search deeper into the game tree, improving decision-making capabilities and ensuring faster performance.
