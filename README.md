# CheckMateAI

## Description

CheckMateAI is a powerful, artificially intelligent checkers player designed using the Minimax algorithm. This game AI can analyze multiple game states and make decisions strategically, creating a challenging gaming experience for checkers enthusiasts.

## Features

- Utilizes Minimax algorithm for decision making.
- Built to provide a challenging AI opponent for a game of checkers.
- Interactive game interface.
- Suitable for both beginners and advanced checkers players looking to up their game.

## Installation

To get started with CheckMateAI, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `https://github.com/<Your_GitHub_Username>/CheckMateAI.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory. For example, `cd CheckMateAI`.
3. Run the AI player by executing the main file. (Specify how to do this based on your project's setup.)

## How It Works

The CheckMateAI uses the Minimax algorithm, a recursive algorithm for decision making. In the context of this game, it's used for choosing the optimal move for the AI player at any given state of the game. 

The Minimax algorithm works by projecting the possible future states of the game (in this case, potential checkers board configurations), and then making a decision based on minimizing the worst-case scenario (i.e., a loss). This allows the AI to make strategic moves and present a formidable challenge to human players.
